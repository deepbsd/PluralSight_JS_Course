# PluralSight Intermediate and ES6 JS Class

This is Mark Zamoyta's Intermediate JS class on Pluralsight.  I've covered all of this stuff
before, but it can't hurt to drill it deeper into my head!

There's some pretty good history here on JS, and that's always helpful, because there's been
a lot of history!  

There's actually a repo within a repo here.  The webpack-starter directory is a repo that
Mark likes to use for small projects like this.  It's simply an npm bundle with live-server
installed...   Not a big deal.
